**Is it back yet?**

If I had a nickel for every time I've heard "Is the internet back yet?" at home in the last few days, I would easily have a couple dollars.

This ruby script coupled with [this ifttt recipe] texts you when the internet is back. I keep the script running on the home computer which is almost always on. Works great for homes in India with spotty internet service.
